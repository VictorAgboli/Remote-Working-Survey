### How has Covid Pandemic impacted the amount of work done remotely? What can be expected post-pandemic?

Due to the COVID, employees have worked remotely, spending less time preparing and commuting to work, but their working hours and time dedicated to personal & family time, domestic responsibiities remains the same. Also, COVID brought work-life balance, saved expenses for the employees but it hindered their ability to socialize, utilize their on-the-job learning with their colleagues, affected their mental health, and ultimately, their job satisfaction.

Shockingly, post-COVID, majority of the employees agree that they would have loved to spend the last quarter of last year working remotely, and going forward, they would love a mix of remote and in-person work routine. This is a policy their employers brought due to COVID and they agreed the policy is fine with them. Also, working remotely (full and part-time) makes employees more active, feel good, and more productive. Working remotely doesn't in any way impact their chances of promotion, it reduces employee attrition, and make teams work better.

Hence, post-pandemic, it's expected that companies would approach working remotely on a full-time or hybrid basis (with flexibility for the employees to choose their workdays), provided barriers such as internet connectivity issues, distraction/noisy environment and difficulty to collaborating with employees can be overcome.


### Does working remotely positively impact productivity? Are they other benefits?

Yes, working remotely positively impacts productivity because majority of the employees agree that their productivity increased by about 10%-50% when working remotely. The other benefits are; it helps reduce time spent preparing and commuting to work by 75% and saves expenses for them.
